## 📈 Key Insights (Summary)

- Categories with the highest average discounts often correspond to products with the lowest average ratings.
- A small number of products generate a large portion of total reviews.
- Certain categories (e.g., Electronics) are price-sensitive, with significant differences between actual and discounted prices.
- Products with high ratings tend to also have more detailed and frequent reviews.
